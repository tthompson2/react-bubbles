A token is used to create a generate an id, which is used to autheticate to a web site. Once the token has been
created for the user they will then be able to access all routes that are protected by the website..

Data can be secured in web apps by putting all of the data that is important, and you only want autheticated users to have
access to behind private routes, which will require authetication to be able to properly see the contents of.

Web servers are used to handle all of the requests that users make to the URL which is then resolved to an IP that connects
to it. Every time a resource is called on by the client (which is a user using some type of browser) the webpage will rerender based on the request
